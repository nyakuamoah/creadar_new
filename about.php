          <p>
          Creadar is the design advocacy wing of Creative Radar, a Ghanaian-registered nonprofit with its funding obtained 
          from a combination of grants, partnerships, and paid-for assignments.<br /><br />
          Our trustee board is composed of three units <span class="t-brand">&mdash; Industry Associates, Review Committee & Partner Organizations</span>
          , which work in sync to ensure the delivery of our brand promise: creating value for organizations and entrepreneurs using design.

          <br /><br /></p>

          <h4 class="subtitle t-brand">Industry Associates</h4>
          <p>At Creadar, the voices of design experts we engage on our projects play a crucial role in our decision-making process. 
          Their shared feedback at the end of each project informs our service design and helps us to continuously fine-tune our organization’s strategy. 
          We therefore consider them as key drivers of our future.<br /><br /></p>
          
          <h4 class="subtitle t-brand">Review Committee</h4>
